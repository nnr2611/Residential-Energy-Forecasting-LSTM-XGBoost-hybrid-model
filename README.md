# Residential-Energy-Forecasting-LSTM-XGBoost-hybrid-model

This project analyses and forecasts residential power consumption using smart meter data. It combines classical machine learning techniques with deep learning models to accurately predict load patterns. 

## üìÅ File Structure

- `IowaState.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the full data pipeline, clustering, and hybrid model training (LSTM + XGBoost).


## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Data Preprocessing and Scaling
- Hierarchical Clustering of Load Profiles
- Cluster-Specific Hybrid Models
- LSTM Sequence Modelling with Attention Mechanism
- XGBoost Regression for Residuals
- Evaluation Metrics: MAE, RMSE, sMAPE
